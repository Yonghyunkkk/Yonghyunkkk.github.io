Lately, I have been working on front-end projects and had to choose between React.js and Next.js. Although I knew that React.js does client-side rendering and Next.js does server-side rendering, I didn't have a deep understanding of their differences. To make an informed decision on which library or framework to use in future projects, I decided to write a post exploring the differences between React.js and Next.js.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that is used for <span style="background:#fff88f">building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications.</span> It is built on top of React and Node.js and provides a set of features and conventions for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

One of the key benefits of using Next.js is its ability to generate static pages at build time, which improves the performance of the application. This is achieved through the use of a feature called <span style="background:#fff88f">"static site generation" (SSG)</span>, which allows Next.js to generate HTML pages for all the pages in your application at build time, which can then be served directly to the client.

Next.js also provides support for <span style="background:#fff88f">server-side rendering,</span> which allows for dynamic content to be rendered on the server and delivered to the client, <span style="background:#fff88f">improving the performance and SEO of your application.</span> Additionally, Next.js provides support for client-side rendering (CSR), which allows for dynamic content to be rendered on the client-side using React.

Next.js also provides a number of other features and conventions that make it easy to build complex web applications, including automatic code splitting, webpack bundling, automatic routing, and support for serverless functions.

Overall, Next.js is a powerful framework for building scalable and high-performance web applications using React and Node.js, with support for <span style="background:#fff88f">static site generation, server-side rendering, and client-side rendering.</span>

## What is React.js?

React.js is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers. React.js allows developers to build complex and interactive UIs using a declarative syntax and a component-based architecture.

The key feature of React.js is its ability to<span style="background:#fff88f"> update the user interface in real-time based on changes to the application state.</span> This is achieved through the use of a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. When the application state changes, React.js updates the virtual DOM and then updates the actual DOM only with the necessary changes. This results in faster and more efficient updates to the user interface.

React.js also provides a <span style="background:#fff88f">component-based architecture,</span> which allows developers to break down complex user interfaces into smaller, reusable components. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the user interface and can be reused throughout the application. This makes it easier to manage and maintain large codebases, and improves the reusability and scalability of the application.

Another important feature of React.js is its <span style="background:#fff88f">use of JSX,</span> which is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. This makes it easier to create and manage the user interface, as it allows developers to write their markup and logic in the same file.

React.js is often used in conjunction with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux for state management, and Next.js for server-side rendering and routing. Overall, React.js is a powerful library for building complex and interactive user interfaces using a declarative syntax and a component-based architecture.

## Which is better React.js or Next.js?

If you choose Next.js, you'll get excellent solutions for server-side rendering and building static websites. Additionally, Next.js comes equipped with a range of tools and features that make project management easy.

Meanwhile, React is the optimal choice for developing user interfaces for single-page applications. By operating at the layer of mobile and web apps, React enables you to create more attractive and user-friendly applications.

## When should you use React.js or Next.js?

If you want to create a web application that's big and complicated, has complicated navigation, and heavily relies on data-driven components, then React could be a suitable choice for you. However, if you want to build a static website or a JAMstack application, then Next.js might be a more appropriate option.
