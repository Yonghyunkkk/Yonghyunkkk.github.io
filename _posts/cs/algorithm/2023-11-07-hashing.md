## Hashing

Hashing consists of **2 parts**.

- A <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow; color: black;">table</span> (an array) of size m(T[0..m-1]).
- A <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow; color: black;">hash function</span> ***h***, which maps a key into an index between 0 and m-1 inclusive.

## Problem with Hashing

2 keys may have the **same** hash value - a <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow; color: black;">collision</span>.

To solve *colilision*, we need:
- A good **hash function**, that avoids collision.
- A collision **resolution strategy**.

## Chaining (Open Hashing)

Keep a <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow; color: black;">linked list</span> of all elements that have the ***same hash value***.

#### Analysis of Chaining

- `Insert` takes constant time **O(1)**.
- `Delete` takes constant time only if the pointer points to the node and the list is a *doubly linked list*, otherwise **O(n)**.
- `Searching` takes **O(n)** at worst case when all the keys are mapped to the same slot.

#### Simple Uniform Hashing

The *performance* of hashing depends a lot on <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow; color: black;">hash functions</span>. The hash function should ***map the keys in the universe as uniformly as possible over the m slots***. Moreover, the *m* slots should be given roughly the ***same number of elements***.

This ideal *hash function* is known as <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow; color: black;">simple uniform hashing</span>.
